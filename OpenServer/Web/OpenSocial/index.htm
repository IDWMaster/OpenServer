        <h1>About us</h1>
	<h1>This is an online web service dedicated to providing its users with free communication</h1>
        <hr />
        <b><u>But lately, due to SOPA, this has been difficult to accomplish</u></b>
        <hr />
        We are publishing this software at a time when the federal government of the United States is about to bring the entirety of the Internet down, in guise of piracy concerns. SOPA will give them the technological means, and the ability to take down popular websites and communication services such as Facebook, YouTube, Google, and Twitter. These services are essential to free press and communication in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
        <br /><b><u>But, it's not entirely their fault</u></b>
        <br />This issue is partially our fault, for engineering the Internet in a way that would make it vulnerable to this kind of censorship. There are too many central points of access to services, known as web sites. These web sites are hosted on web servers, which; if taken down, will completely interrupt a user's ability to access a broad set of communication mechanisms and information. For example, if Facebook were taken down, you would be unable to use Facebook chat, and communicate with your friends over Facebook. 
        <br /><b><u>P2P networks are the solution to this problem, by allowing users to communicate directly with each other, instead of relying on a server hosted by a large corporation, which could be easily taken down</u></b>
        <br />P2P services are not vulnerable to complete takedown or censorship, due to the nature of their communication. P2P networks do not rely on central servers; therefore, to take down our new social network, you would need to shut down EVERY single computer that is using it! This would be extremely impractical for both a censorship bureau, and for a malicious attacker to do.
